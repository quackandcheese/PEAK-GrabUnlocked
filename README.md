# Grab Unlocked

You can now pull/grab your friends from any direction, climbing, standing, or in the air! Fully configurable.

## Information

Players no longer have to be climbing to be pulled. Players can be pulled even if they are higher than the one trying to pull them.

These fields are configurable:
- Maximum grab distance
- Whether or not you can grab from any height
- Whether or not you can grab even when players are not climbing
